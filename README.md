# Gogh On!
A virtual collaborative drawing space where users express their creativity - together!

Consists of two modes:\
 - Free draw on one canvas with friends
 - Each player gets 15 seconds to draw on the canvas

## Current Features
  - generate an avatar
  - create a room
  - generate a link to the room (to copy/paste to friends)
  - chat with users in your room (while you wait for everyone to join)
  - START a session where you can draw and chat with friends
  - When you're done:
      - END your session by pressing 'end session' in your drawing toolbox
      - SAVE your piece to your computer, or scrap it/start a new session!
                                   


## Starting Server Locally
 Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!
```
start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don't want to run your seed script separately)
```
